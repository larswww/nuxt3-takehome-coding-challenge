# Project Description

I wanted to deploy a version of the frontpage and tv-show page that is faster than tvmaze.com. Given the heavy scripts 
and ads that tvmaze.com loads, that might be easy. However, they might also have 0ms latency from their API, 


# Deployment
To deploy the project you need to have [CloudFlare Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update/) 
installed and activated with a CloudFlare account.
